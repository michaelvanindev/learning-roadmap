# Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my **Learning Roadmap** repository! This repo is dedicated to mapping out my personal learning journey in web development, software engineering, and related technologies over the next year. It will include my learning goals, resources, projects, and notes as I work toward improving my skills and mastering new technologies.

## Learning Goals
I am on a mission to learn and improve my web development and software engineering skills by dedicating 30 minutes per day, 6 days a week. Here are some key areas I plan to focus on:

- **Web Development Fundamentals**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and web design principles.
- **Backend Development**: Node.js, Express, databases, and RESTful APIs.
- **Version Control with Git & GitHub**: Learn Git commands, best practices, and collaboration workflows.
- **Frameworks & Libraries**: Dive deeper into React, Vue.js, or Angular (depending on preferences).
- **Deployment and DevOps**: Learn about hosting, CI/CD pipelines, and using cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
- **Testing & Debugging**: Learn testing frameworks like Jest and Cypress.
- **Web Performance**: Study performance optimization, lazy loading, and responsive design.

## Weekly Progress
Each week, I will document what I've learned, projects I've completed, and any challenges I've faced. This will help me stay on track and measure my progress.

### Week 1: HTML & CSS Basics
- Learned the basics of HTML structure, tags, attributes, and semantic HTML.
- Explored CSS properties like margin, padding, flexbox, and grid layout.
- Completed a simple webpage project that includes text, images, and links.

### Week 2: JavaScript Fundamentals
- Covered variables, data types, loops, conditionals, and functions.
- Explored JavaScript arrays, objects, and built-in methods.
- Created a small interactive app that accepts user input.

### Week 3: Version Control with Git & GitHub
- Learned how to use `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`.
- Created my first GitHub repository and learned about branches, pull requests, and collaboration.
- Started my personal **Learning GitHub** repo to document progress.

## Resources
Here is a collection of resources I will use to learn and practice throughout the year:
- **MDN Web Docs**: Great for understanding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **freeCodeCamp**: Offers structured lessons and projects for web development.
- **Codecademy**: Provides interactive tutorials on various web development topics.
- **GitHub Learning Lab**: Learn how to use GitHub with guided tutorials.
- **YouTube Channels**:
  - **Traversy Media**
  - **The Net Ninja**
  - **Academind**
